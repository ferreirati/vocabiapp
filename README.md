# VocabiApp

## What is this app?

This a **vocabulary trainer for foreign languages**, the game is as follows,
you sign up (just using your email), specify your **original** language and your
**target** language (the one on that you want to improve your vocabulary)
pick a *part of speech* category, i.e, pronouns, verbs, etc. After selecting
the category, click on a level, inside the level, you'll need to translate the
displayed words into your original language, answering correctly gives you
