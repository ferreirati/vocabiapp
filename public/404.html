<!-- 
  Priority order of Hosting responses:
    1 - Reserved namespaces that begin with a /__/* path segment
    2 - Configured redirects
    3 - Exact-match static content
    4 - Configured rewrites
    5 - Custom 404 page
    6 - Default 404 page

  Since we're trusting on rewrites (rule 4) we cant have an exact match static content on the hosting directory.
  But we need some file there in order to deploy hosting, this file is a Custom 404 page (rule 5).
